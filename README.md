# PureAura---AI
Easing the ability to breath for the residents of the Hong Kong's sub divided units

PureAura AI redefines urban health through a synergistic Human-AI partnership. In Hong Kong’s 
subdivided units, residents face invisible respiratory hazards that city-level sensors miss. Our 
project augments human ingenuity by transforming "black box" environmental data into intuitive, 
actionable intelligence. 
Embedding hyper-local AI analytics into Lingnan University’s award-winning innovative air purifier 
PureAura, our system conducts real-time analysis of historical and environmental data to predict air 
quality shifts, providing residents with personalized, actionable "nudges."
Acting as an interactive advisor, PureAura AI sends timely notifications – such as alerts to close 
windows during peak street-level smog or reminders to activate purifiers – fostering proactive 
health awareness. Crucially, a human-in-the-loop feedback mechanism allows users to log 
preferences, refining model accuracy and ensuring alerts remain helpful, not overwhelming. 
By bridging data science and human intuition, PureAura AI empowers vulnerable communities to 
outpace environmental hazards, proving that engineering is most impactful when it amplifies human 
ingenuity.
